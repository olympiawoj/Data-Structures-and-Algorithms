# Trees üå≤

### Trees
- Trees are a data structure that consist of _nodes_ in a _parent/child relationship_ with one _root_ node. 

### Tree Examples 
- Folders in an operating system üìÅ e.g. 
    Username/
        Desktop/
            Coding Folder/     Personal Folder/
                file file           file file 
- HTML DOM
- A decision tree
-  [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree), which is a self-balancing ordered variant of the BST. B-trees play a critical role in database and file system indexing.
- AVL tree, which is a self-balancing BST and the prefix tree, which is specialized for handling text.

### Trees vs. [Lists](../doubly-linked-list/README.md) 
- Lists are LINEAR- one line through our data structure
- Tree are NONLINEAR- they can branch and have multiple different pathways
- A singly linked list is a special case of a tree

### Trees vs. [Graphs](../graphs/README.md) 
- Trees are a subset of a graph. but a restricted form of a graph
- Any tree is a type of graph but not all graphs will be trees (e.g. trees have a root node while graphs do not, graphs can be _cyclic_ and _acyclic_ while trees are always _acyclic_)

### Tree Definitions
- **Root:** The top node in a tree
- **Child:** A node directly connected to another node when moving _away_ from the root
- **Parent:** The node above a child
- **Leaf:** A node with no children
- **Edge:** The connection between one node and another

### Tree Rules
- **All trees must have a root node.** A root node can never have any edges or links connecting to it.
- **Tree must flow in ONE direction** from root/parent to child (can never go from child to parent/root)

## Binary Tree Rules Rules
- **Binary Trees** can only AT MOST 2 CHILDREN NODES. It can have 0, 1, or 2 children. That's it. 
- This means a binary tree can only have 2 subtrees within.
- Same rules apply to **ternary** trees (3 children)


## Binary Search Trees Rules
- **## Binary Search Trees** are a special type of binary tree. 
- They excel at searching so we store sorted data in a particular way in a binary search tree which makes it easier to retrieve. 
- They are used to _store data that are SORTED in a a paricular way_



### What's _NOT_ a tree?
- A tree as ONE entry point/root. If there are more, then it is NOT a tree. 
- Nodes MUST reference their children. If nodes reference siblings or any nodes below them, it is NOT a tree
- All nodes have to move AWAY from the parent code, all arrows must point down


### How is the root element of a Binary Search Tree decided?
- **The first element added to a BST is the root of the tree.**
- However, doing it this way means that it's a very simple matter to end up with a lopsided BST. If we simply insert a monotonically ascending or descending sequence of values, then the tree would essentially flatten down to a linked list, and we'd lose all the benefits that a BST is supposed to confer. 
- Self-balancing variants of the BST exist in order to alleviate this exact problem.

### What is the difference between a Search and a Traversal?
- A search and a traversal are processed exactly the same.  The difference is:
- **In a search:** we stop when we find what we were looking for, or when all nodes have been visited without finding it 
- **In a traversal:** we always keep going until we've visited every node 

### What is the difference between Breadth First and Depth First?
- **Depth First:** Pick one path at each branch and keep going DOWN/forward until we hit a dead end, then  backtrack and take the first branch we find. 
- **Breadth First:** We go by layers, one row deeper each time.  This means that we jump around a bit.





### Binary Search Trees
* Should have the methods `insert`, `contains`, `get_max`.
  * `insert` adds the input value to the binary search tree, adhering to the rules of the ordering of elements in a binary search tree.
  * `contains` searches the binary search tree for the input value, returning a boolean indicating whether the value exists in the tree or not.
  * `get_max` returns the maximum value in the binary search tree.
  * `for_each` performs a traversal of _every_ node in the tree, executing the passed-in callback function on each tree node value. There is a myriad of ways to perform tree traversal; in this case any of them should work.

What are real-world use-cases for a Binary Search Tree data structure?

A BST in the way that is being implemented for this Sprint is a bit too simple to see any real-world use-cases. There are many (more complex) variants of BSTs that do see production use. One very notable variant is the B-tree, which is a self-balancing ordered variant of the BST. B-trees play a critical role in database and file system indexing. Other notable variants include the AVL tree, which is a self-balancing BST and the prefix tree, which is specialized for handling text.

How is the root element of a Binary Search Tree decided?

What is the difference between Breadth First and Depth First?

In depth first, we pick one path at each branch and keep going forward until we hit a dead end, then backtrack and take the first branch we find. In breadth first, we go by layers, one row deeper each time. This means that we jump around a bit.

What is the difference between a Search and a Traversal?

A search and a traversal are processed exactly the same. The difference is that we stop a search when we find what we were looking for, or when all nodes have been visited without finding it. In a traversal, we always keep going until we've visited every node.
