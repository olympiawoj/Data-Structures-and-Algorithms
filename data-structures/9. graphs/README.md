## What are Graphs?
- A data structure that represents a collection of nodes and edges (which represent related data)
- They're _connections_ between  _nodes_
    - Nodes are called vertices, vertexes, and verts
    - Connections are called _edges_
- They're a non-linear data structure (as oppposed to a linked list, stack, or queue)

**A graph is a set of nodes/vertices and edges**
- Nodes can be connected by an  _edges_ or _connections_. Edges can connect nodes in ANY way they want. This connection represents a relationship or link between two nodes
- Can have many nodes, but it really only needfs one node to be a graph

### Graph Theory
- In math, graphs are just a way to represent a network. They're a collection of objects we order in a specific way that are all interconnected. 
- In math terms, we describe graphs as ordered pairs. In basic algebra, simplest ordered pair is (x, y)
- In graphs, it's G = (V, E). 
- However, in most graphs, we have more than 1 vertex and many edges.
    - So V is not 1 vertex, but the _set of vertices_ that make up the graph 
    - Similarly, E is not 1 edge but rather the _set of edges_ that make up the graph 
- In mathematics, **graphs** are defined as ordered pairs, with two parts: vertices and edges 
    - **Set of vertices** --> all of the nodes the graph has
    - **Set of edges** --> all of the links between those nodes
- In mathematics, the use of graph theory was to represent a network of interconnected objects
- When we think about how CS represents interconnected objects, those objects are the nodes and edges.


## Graphs vs. [Trees](../trees/README.md)  
- See trees here
- Trees flow in ONE direction, from the root node to child nodes. 
- Graphs have no formal starting point/ no root node. 

##
## Three Steps for solving ANY graph problem
1. Translate the problem into graph terminology
    - What are the nodes?
    - What are the edges?
    - Is it directed or undirected?
    - Is it cyclical or acyclical?
    - Is it weighted or unweighted?
2. Build your graph
3. Traverse your graph - using DFS or BFS

## Two Kinds of graphs
1. Directed - edges that function like one way streets (I follow you on Twitter, but you don't follow me)
2. Undirected - edges flow bi-directionally, like a two-way street (Your friends with me on Facebook, I'm freinds with you on Facebook.)

### Breadth vs Depth first search/traversals
- **Breadth First** goes ROW BY ROW to siblings before children
- **Depth First** goes DOWN VERTICALLY to all childs before siblings

### Definitions
- **Directed**: If edges are "one way" (have an arrow), the graph is directed, can only go from ONE node to another. (A) -> (B) means we can only travel from A to B, not from B to A. 
- **Undirected**: If there are no arrows, the edges are _bidirectional_. This means we can travel to both nodes in both directions. 
- **Cyclical vs. Acyclical**: If you can follow the edges and arrive at a node you've alrady visited, the graph is _cyclic_, otherwise it is _acyclic_ 
- **Weighted vs. Unweighted**: Graphs with values or _weights_ associated with the edges are _weighted_. Graphs with no values are _unweighted_. 
- **Dense vs. Sparse**: A graph where most vertices are connected to eachother is _dense). A graph with less connections is _sparse). 

## Graph Representations
Two most common ways are adjacency lists and an adjacency matrix
- **Adjacency Matrix**- a matrix representation of eactly WHICH nodes in the graph contain edges between them denoted by 0s (no edge between nodes) and 1s (an edge exists between the two nodes)
    - Matrix is represented as a 2D array or list of lists
    - Looking up, inserting, and removing an edge is O(1) constant time
    - Consumes O(V^2) amount of space
    - If a graph is sparse, the matrix will be mostly filled with 0s and take up a lot of space

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,1,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [1,0,0,0,0,1,0]]
```

- **Adjacency List**- Each vertex is given an index in a list and has alll of it's neighboring vertices stored as an _array/linked list_, _adjacent_ to it. 

Note that this adjacency list doesn't actually use any lists. The `vertices` collection is a `dictionary` which lets us access each collection of edges in O(1) constant time while the edges are contained in a `set` which lets us check for the existence of edges in O(1) constant time.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {
                          "A": {"B"},
                          "B": {"C", "D"},
                          "C": {"E"},
                          "D": {"F", "G"},
                          "E": {"C"},
                          "F": {"C"},
                          "G": {"A", "F"}
                        }
```


    - Retrieving a node's neighbors takes O(1) constant time (since we only need the node's index to get it's list of adjcaent neighbors)
    - To find a _specific_ edge (x, y), we need to find the vertex x's adjacency list which takes O(1) and look to see if y is in that list. Worst case, this takes O(d) time where d is the degree of vertex x. 
- **Edge List**



For the following:

```
V: Total number of vertices in the graph
E: Total number of edges in the graph
e: Average number of edges per vertex
```

### Space Complexity
* **Adjacency Matrix**: O(V ^ 2)
* **Adjacency List**: O(V + E)
- Takeaway: Adjacency lists are more space efficient for __sparse__ graphs while adjacency matrices become efficient for __dense__ graphs.
### Add Vertex
* **Adjacency Matrix**: O(V)
* **Adjacency List**: O(1)
- Takeaway: Adding vertices is very efficient in adjacency lists but very inefficient for adjacency matrices.
### Remove Vertex
* **Adjacency Matrix**: O(V ^ 2)
* **Adjacency List**: O(V)
- Takeaway: Removing vertices is inefficient in both adjacency matrices and lists but more inefficient in matrices.
### Add Edge
* **Adjacency Matrix**: O(1)
* **Adjacency List**: O(1)
- Takeaway: Adding edges to both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.
### Remove Edge
* **Adjacency Matrix**: O(1)
* **Adjacency List**: O(1)
- Takeaway: Removing edges from both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.
### Find Edge
* **Adjacency Matrix**: O(1)
* **Adjacency List**: O(1)
- Takeaway: Finding edges from both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.
### Get All Edges from Vertex
* **Adjacency Matrix**: O(V)
* **Adjacency List**: O(1)
- Takeaway: Fetching all edges is more efficient in an adjacency list than an adjacency matrix.


## Building a Graph Class
1. Create class Graph 
2. Add def__init__(self) method which represents a graph of vertices mapping lebsl to edges
3. def add_vertex method: t
4. Instantiate the graph first adding *nodes* then adding all *edges*

## DFS vs. BFS
- Breadth first uses **queues** which are like a bathroom line- FIFO (first in, first out)
    - Enqueue is adding to the back (append)
    - Dequeue is removing from front (pop at index 0)
- Depth first uses **stacks** and can do _recursion_. Stacks are like a stack of books- LIFO (last in, first out) or FILO (first in, last out)
    - Push adds to the back (append)
    - Pop removes from the back (LIFO)

v1 and v2 is one single edge in the graph. It identifers the edge that connects these two nodes. 

A and B is one edge
B and A is one edge - same thing
This is bc of the fact that this is an undirected edge. Easy to go from one vertex to the other ane vice versa.

Bit minor but if you guys wanted better formatting for your terminal for dictionaries:
there's the pprint module with the pformat method that converts a dictionary into a more readable string with line breaks
import pprint
print(f"Friendships: \n{pprint.pformat(sg.friendships)}")



**Advantages of BFS:-**

1. Solution will definitely found out by BFS If there are some solution.2. BFS will never get trapped in blind alley , means unwanted nodes.3. If there are more than one solution then it will find solution with minimal steps.

**Disadvantages Of BFS :**

-1. Memory Constraints As it stores all the nodes of present level to go for next level.2. If solution is far away then it consumes time.

**Application Of BFS :**

-1.Finding Shortest Path.2.Checking graph with bipertiteness.3.Copying cheiney's Algorithm.

**Advantages Of DFS**

:-1. Memory requirement is Linear WRT Nodes.2. Less time and space complexity rather than BFS.3. Solution can be found out by without much more search.

**Disadvantage of DFS :-**

1. Not Guaranteed that it will give you solution.2. Cut-off depth is smaller so time complexity is more.3. Determination of depth until the search has proceeds.

**Applications of DFS:-**

1. Finding Connected components.2. Topological sorting.3. Finding Bridges of graph.
