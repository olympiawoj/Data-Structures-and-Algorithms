**Python Collections**
- @ the end of this lesson you should be able to: differentiate between Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries and perform basic operations on each type of Collection
- **Collections** are diff containers we can use to store collections of data.
- Built in collections: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.


- **Lists -** group of items we reference by index, ARE mutable, and allow duplicate items
    - **Mutable vs Immutable**- can we change the contents of this thing or can we not change it?
- **Tuples-** Group of items we reference by index, NOT mutable, and allow duplicate items
- **Sets-** unordered group of items. ARE mutable (cannot CHANGE, only ADD), DO NOT contain duplicate elements
- **Dictionaries-** Group of values we reference trough their KEYS. ARE mutable and allow duplicate items.
