âœ¨ Implementation of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript and Python 

## What are Algorithms?
- A program, or set of instructions, that solves a problem 
- A series of steps for solving a problem
- Often involves traversing through a data structure.


## What are Data Structures? 
- A data structure is an organization of data such that it can be accessed and modified in a particular manner. 

## What is Big O
